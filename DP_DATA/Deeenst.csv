it's not the same as any opioid. it's only a partial opioid. definitely not like methadone. it doesn't help pain in people used to regular pain medication. there's a ceiling affect on analgesia. it may help if your opioid naive or are given break through pain medication.,2020-03-01 23:30:41+00:00,,,1234259796167200770,,https://twitter.com/Deeenst/status/1234259796167200770,2,2,fightpaindaily,
