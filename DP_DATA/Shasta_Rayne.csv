thank you! i appreciate the support and i am doing my best. we will keep plugging away on this. our lawmakers have to fess up to knowing about this. the lawmakers and the researchers who have been engaged in this. solutions will come if we start being honest.,2020-03-01 03:07:33+00:00,,,1233951984153063424,,https://twitter.com/Shasta_Rayne/status/1233951984153063424,0,0,HarleyNosYa,
