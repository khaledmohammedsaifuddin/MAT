this doesn't address overdose as much as cravings. i would imagine the plasma concentration is more indicative of protection than dose...might be something about that in sublocade lit. i feel like i rarely see ppl even try to use opioids if they are on 8+ mg of suboxone.,2020-07-21 01:07:49+00:00,,,1285380931151376385,,https://twitter.com/tmc_RN/status/1285380931151376385,1,0,tmc_RN,
