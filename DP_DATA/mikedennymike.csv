meh...to be honest i've never bought into that distinction. it seems wildly popular now and i think it gets into fruitless territory. ppl who say self-serving things are self-serving. ppl who are self-serving say self-serving things. we are what we do. that's my take at least.,2020-07-05 21:19:32+00:00,,,1279887664070692864,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1279887664070692864,1,0,MonicaBaumann,
to the first question yes! if you define a term too broadly it doesn't have any meaning. if we called all ppl self-serving than we couldn't identify those that are moreso than others. same way we can't call all ppl 'tall' if we want the term 'tall' to have a practical purpose.,2020-07-05 20:54:03+00:00,,,1279881248169754624,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1279881248169754624,1,0,MonicaBaumann,

there's something wrong with the last graph in that vox article. native ams were up to 4x more likely to be killed by police than black ppl and 6.5x more likely than white ppl when i was reading up on this.,2020-06-02 17:19:37+00:00,,,1267868484584734720,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1267868484584734720,0,0,vivabuck,
a white male in oklahoma city is much more likely to be murdered by police than a black person in ny. though there's also no denying that there is a stable disparity in over-representation of black americans among those killed by police. it's just not as wide as often assumed.,2020-06-02 17:15:05+00:00,,,1267867345831280640,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1267867345831280640,1,0,mikedennymike,

american deaths were doubling every 3 days. 2 weeks after the shutdowns and we're seeing the reduction of growth. on sunday night the us was sitting at approx 10k deaths. 3 days later it's at 14k (instead of 20). shutdowns work. maybe even better than we thought.,2020-04-09 01:14:57+00:00,,,1248056774894198785,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1248056774894198785,0,0,,

i guess i'm trying to give the postmodern devil it's due. the fact that any given set af data can be interpreted in an infinite number of ways is true. but i agree with you that going down this road is fraught with chaos and danger. for me....the way out is pragmatism.,2020-03-02 07:00:26+00:00,,,1234372979892596738,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1234372979892596738,1,0,mikedennymike,
one step before the flag are virtually indistinguishable. yet our category system treats them the same as the polar opposites of the tunnel. for some...this is cause to joyfully dismantle our flawed categories. for me...it means our categories are imperfect but useful.,2020-03-02 06:46:08+00:00,,,1234369381674692609,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1234369381674692609,1,0,mikedennymike,
"agreed. imagine a tunnel, 100k long. it's color starts out green and slowly changes shade until the opposite end that is yellow. the flag we plant at the midway point to declare 'the tunnel is now yellow' is where deconstructionists love to dwell. one step past the flag and...",2020-03-02 06:43:28+00:00,,,1234368710338646016,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1234368710338646016,1,0,pammalamma,
could you expand? i think i understand. i do not subscribe to most modern decontructionism. i have a pragmatic approach. i think it's dangerous to deconstruct language which is useful.,2020-03-02 06:31:38+00:00,,,1234365730222673920,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1234365730222673920,0,0,pammalamma,
differentiating packing snow from powder snow from slushy snow etc. a society that never sees snow has no use for these categories. the categories themselves are not in nature. we identify and establish categories when it becomes beneficial to do so.,2020-03-02 06:29:43+00:00,,,1234365251241553921,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1234365251241553921,0,0,mikedennymike,
most of us heard the cliche 'the inuit have 100 different words for snow'. apparently it's not true....but that's the point i'm making here. our systems of classification are determined by function/usefulness. that's what is meant by social construct. the inuit have a use in....,2020-03-02 06:25:41+00:00,,,1234364234940780545,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1234364234940780545,1,0,mikedennymike,

we still needed to decide where to plant flags and how many flags to plant in establishing our race categories. the level of abstraction we choose to use is a variable. we could have made 1000s of categories. we could have made 3.,2020-03-02 06:20:08+00:00,,,1234362839583903746,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1234362839583903746,1,0,pammalamma,
the argument here does not deny that group based differences can be identified in humans. but the categories we divide ourselves up into are not cleanly determined by these differences...as often assumed. nor are they universal....they vary cross-culturally.,2020-03-02 06:15:20+00:00,,,1234361628520570880,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1234361628520570880,0,0,mikedennymike,
this is a super complicated issue but one note here: it's only descendants of west african societies that are at risk of sickle cell (which is why it's common in us) yet the term 'black' is also used in the us for ppl descendant from east african societies (who arent at risk).,2020-03-02 06:03:55+00:00,,,1234358757951492097,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1234358757951492097,1,0,pammalamma,
i'm not a trained fighter so it was really just luck. what surprised me most is how vulnerable someone is when you're holding their foot at head level. i could have gently nudged him wherever i wanted and he would've went flying.,2020-03-01 21:25:28+00:00,,,1234228284411564032,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1234228284411564032,0,0,Wit_recycler,
