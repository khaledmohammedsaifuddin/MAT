for sure. my reasoning is this does two things: 1 actually more effective with the target demo (homeless/mental health plus addiction) 2 does not change the foot traffic of addicts in a city into communities that deserve to be excluded from by-products of homeless addiction,2020-02-25 05:30:46+00:00,,,1232176087683260416,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1232176087683260416,1,0,SkepticReview89,
"i'm saying though..... publically funded van(s). cheaper, more effective, will actually result in more clean needles used, will get out on frontlines. homeless ppl don't go to services. services have to go to homeless ppl. including opiate addiction.",2020-02-25 05:24:56+00:00,,,1232174619194535937,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1232174619194535937,1,0,mikedennymike,
that's true. especially for homeless ppl. they're the last people who'd be discouraged by a fentanyl cut. a site could confiscate something deemed to dangerous...but even lowers the non-existing incentive for someone to go there in the first place.,2020-02-25 05:22:30+00:00,,,1232174006947676162,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1232174006947676162,1,0,SkepticReview89,
fact is...if there was an incentive for a homeless addict to attend these sites they'd be filled to the brim all opening hours. it's a fundamental misunderstanding of the homeless addict mindstate to think they are gonna commute to a place to use the drugs they already possess.,2020-02-25 05:13:30+00:00,,,1232171743512530946,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1232171743512530946,0,0,mikedennymike,

in calgary/toronto...what opening up one of these sites does is change the foot traffic of addicts and the drug trade into the communities chosen for site location. most cities don't have as easy a time targetting a particular location to put such a site.,2020-02-25 05:03:10+00:00,,,1232169141353820160,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1232169141353820160,2,0,mikedennymike,

this exchange is about 'safe injection sites'. so noone is giving any drugs to addicts. safe injection sites do not provide drugs. but if that's the topic you wish to address....portugal is providing addicts with drugs. with enormous success.,2020-02-25 04:55:05+00:00,,,1232167107837800448,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1232167107837800448,0,0,jeh7041,
one thing (and they might have already started doing this) that would make these sights much more relevant is if they offered purity testing. so you pour out a couple grains of your stash and they test it for cuts like fentanyl. that would be a great implementation if feasible.,2020-02-25 04:49:59+00:00,,,1232165822405238786,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1232165822405238786,1,1,mikedennymike,
i probably saw the same one. i certainly don't think homeless opiate addicts aren't a problem worth addressing. but we should be careful not frame the opiate epidemic at large as limited to this particular set of parameters.,2020-02-25 04:44:45+00:00,,,1232164507348324352,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1232164507348324352,1,0,catbirdoffice,
i don't think this really addresses the opiate epidemic though. it's likely that every single one of us knows an opiate addict at work and doesn't know it. this is for intersectional cases....homeless + addiction + mental health. but that's not what is driving the epidemic.,2020-02-25 04:40:48+00:00,,,1232163514283892736,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1232163514283892736,1,0,catbirdoffice,

yes i think so. they mostly originiated in the early 00's if memory serves. the target demo were homeless drug addicts. but that's a very small % of addicts as a whole. and again...ppl start hanging out around the site knowing that it's now a destination for drug trade.,2020-02-25 04:31:42+00:00,,,1232161221136306176,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1232161221136306176,1,0,SkepticReview89,

do you agree with me that both play a role? there is alot of resistance to the idea that there are genetic differences between our socially constructed race categories and that these differences impact results.,2020-02-21 04:08:10+00:00,,,1230705749388455937,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1230705749388455937,1,0,mikedennymike,
for sure. that's why i said both. for example...it's often asserted black ppl win the 100 meter race consistently because of thigh muscles. well thigh muscles are certainly crucial for hockey too and black ppl are under-represented in it.,2020-02-21 04:00:56+00:00,,,1230703926728507398,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1230703926728507398,1,0,C_Kavanagh,

to be honest...i've really shifted on this. as a teen as i was totally on the nurture side and was essentially a blank slatist for the most part. when i had a kid (22) i started changing my mind. then my best friend's family has me clearly leaning nature now tbh. lol,2020-02-21 00:49:55+00:00,,,1230655857165250560,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1230655857165250560,2,0,mvthomster,

this has been clear in the discussions of the meaning of 'work' in regard to dawkin's recent post about eugenics. since we can't define what 'works' means....the whole argument is thrown up in the air as nonsense. but this is the correspondance approach to language and truth.,2020-02-18 09:46:00+00:00,,,1229703605139189763,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1229703605139189763,1,0,mikedennymike,

the whole 'what is a chair' question was meant to break down previous assumptions. if you sit on a foot-stool it's effectively a 'chair' sure. but the intention was never to claim that 'there are no such things as chairs'.,2020-02-18 09:33:57+00:00,,,1229700569985581056,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1229700569985581056,2,1,mikedennymike,

i'm sympathetic to the argument that ubi is the necessary option bc of deeply entrenched cultural beliefs in the us. it is extremely inefficient imo and the justifications for it as compared to gbi are abstract in nature imo. but i think we all agree on the basic diagnosis here.,2020-01-30 20:20:22+00:00,,,1222977878167638016,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1222977878167638016,1,0,nathan66669,
i don't see it. living off the gbi threshold will also be substantially below the income of switching jobs. i agree that ubi is better than nothing. but we're in fact talking about trillions of dollars paid out to ppl who don't need it bc of a mindset and/or psych stigma?,2020-01-30 19:57:05+00:00,,,1222972016548024322,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1222972016548024322,2,0,nathan66669,

i've met many people who were serious oxycodone addicts. up to 1000mg per day (which is equivalent to 200 percocets). many have reported taking 10 top 15 grams of kratom during withdrawal eases approx 50% of the wd symptoms.,2020-01-10 05:48:40+00:00,,,1215510748706889729,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1215510748706889729,2,0,folding_laundry,

when i give kratom samples out to addicts....i tell them not to even bother unless they're in the throws of withdrawal and have absolutely no opiates in their system. i don't know enough about that dosage of codeine but i'd bet it's enough to lessen the impact of the kratom.,2020-01-10 05:21:25+00:00,,,1215503893540622336,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1215503893540622336,2,0,catbirdoffice,

making things even more confusing....opiates themselves are stimulating in small doses. so even red-leaf kratom is stimulating even if sedating in large doses. but i generally concur that green leaf is similar to adderall/dexedrine/speed and red leaf similar to dope.,2020-01-10 04:27:37+00:00,,,1215490353974972416,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1215490353974972416,1,0,catbirdoffice,
there's mixed opinions about this. but there's several different types of kratom leaves which mostly depend on when and where they are harvested. generally speaking....'green leaf' is thought to be simulating.

one has to wonder how this will play out. the majority of america are poor white ppl. it seems only natural that eventually they will get sick of this. it seems likely that there will be some reactionary blowback which is also morally regressive but in the opposite direction.,2019-12-15 22:33:22+00:00,,,1206341506061217792,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1206341506061217792,0,0,mikedennymike,

right. so it depends on what=outcome we choose yah? let's call the fat kid's body an 'outcome'. in defining the winner of the 'fair race' as the 'optimum outcome' (one resulting from equality of opp) we make an arbitrary choice to emphasize one outcome construct over any other.,2019-12-13 01:11:55+00:00,,,1205294241737515008,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1205294241737515008,2,0,Evolving_Ego,

you could have a point here but i'd need to see stats for a-s acts of violence and harassment in euro countries that have not experienced in influx of muslim immigration and how they compare to those that have. afaik...the spikes aren't comparable.,2019-10-25 02:13:42+00:00,,,1187552784616431616,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1187552784616431616,0,0,C_Kavanagh,

where i live....white ppl who are anti-semitic are stigmatized. it's not fringe with muslims. it's extremely common and it's out in the open. that's just a fact here. i suspect england and france are similar.,2019-10-25 02:00:57+00:00,,,1187549578524069889,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1187549578524069889,1,0,mikedennymike,

are anti immigration parties in ghana or iraq or india also xenophobic? i suppose it's possible to say yes. but that sets a use of the term 'xenphobic' that i think is much too broad. i think anti immigration policy can be distinguished from xenophobia.,2019-10-02 14:55:40+00:00,,,1179409620835667968,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1179409620835667968,0,0,mikedennymike,
'fearing foreigners' is distinct from supporting limited immigration policy. every country in the world has political factions that support stricter immigration policies. it's a universal stance on a given nation's politics. it doesn't not exist. anywhere.,2019-10-02 14:47:30+00:00,,,1179407566788579330,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1179407566788579330,2,0,jefus76,

i know that the academic roots aren't overlaps. during my stint in it.....ct theorists were constantly critiquing pomo. as it's manifested popular culture since approx 2010....i think a hybrid has formed (despite inherent contradictions between the two).,2019-10-01 21:00:16+00:00,,,1179138989074321408,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1179138989074321408,1,0,,

i certainly can't quantify/prove it. but a typical 8 hour shift of mixing the audio on the canadian cnn....my estimate is around 70% of the social scientists we skype with on-air are ct proponents to some degree (often just judging by the terms they use).,2019-10-01 20:23:23+00:00,,,1179129704361668609,,https://twitter.com/mikedennymike/status/1179129704361668609,1,0,NickWolfinger,
