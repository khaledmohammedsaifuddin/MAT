"definitely. i call it a ""deer in the headlights"" kind of day. that feeling where you freeze up despite knowing you need to be all kinds of productive. it's very frustrating. i hope things get better tomorrow!",2019-10-08 20:13:07+00:00,,,1181663835058405376,,https://twitter.com/back2brains/status/1181663835058405376,0,0,RolandNadler,
